                            <p class="small">Jesse is a StudyHaven tutor who teaches my son Michael 11+ maths and Michael would always tell me how much Jesse encourages him. It's relieved the pressure off me to home-school him. Jesse has helped Michael build his confidence not just in his studies but also in his life choices. I cannot thank him and StudyHaven enough!</p>

                            <p class="small">I currently have the A-Level Maths and Economics workbooks and they've been so useful in preparing for my teacher assessments! As I'm unable to take exams this year due to the pandemic, I still needed resources to help me stay sane and feel confident. StudyHaven workbooks are the way to go!</p>

                            <p class="small">I was tutored by Nicole throughout my first year of GCSE Economics. Her approach to teaching is so good! She broke everything down to basics making it easy for me to understand. We are continuing the sessions so that I can stay ahead of the class amidst this pandemic!</p>

                            <p class="small">I am currently studying A-Level Business Studies alongside my internship. I always have a lot of case studies to write and minutes to take. I absolutely love the feel of the StudyHaven notepads and the fine tip quality of their pens - makes note-taking more enjoyable.</p>
